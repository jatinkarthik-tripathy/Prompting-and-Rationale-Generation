- Stages:
	- 1: Text Prompts only 
		- Hugging-face interactive models
		- prompt engineering
        - text to text models  
    - 2.1: ImageClassification2txt
        - Using Image classification models to generate tags
        - tags used to text generation
	- 2.2: Visual Multi modal img2txt
		- eg CLIP 
		- image captioning generation first to see how well the model works with image
		- and then try to do prompt engineering for justification
	- 3: Evaluation 
		- what would be the classes to consider for justification 
		- evaluation crowd source
		- automated system to evaluate?
	- 4: V/C models and Paid Token Models + Eval
