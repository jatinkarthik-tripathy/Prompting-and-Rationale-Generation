Stage 1:
- Using only text prompts only
- Includes task of prompt enggineering
    - asking "why" in different words eg "why", "explain", "why do you think so"
    - experimenting with giving the model a tag line before the prompts
        - inconclusive results
- trying zero/few shot attempts are getting the model to explain why its own outputs
- models tested: BLOOM (unable to compile locally), GPT-j-6b, GPT-new=2.7b, GPT-2
- dataset used: SemEval 2022 task 4 - PCL identification
